# Icons
A collection of Material Design icons, taken from https://material.io/icons/ .

The `Icon` component provides a standard wrapper, setting the base config,
and each icon then simply supplies the content. One may pass attrs
to the icons, which then override the base attrs.

The following icons are provided: `clear`, `delete`,
`delete-sweep`, `done`, `done-all`, `edit`, `swap-vert`.
